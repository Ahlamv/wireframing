# Wireframing: From Sketch to Prototype

## Introduction

Welcome! üëã  
This project is all about **wireframing** ‚Äì a key step in designing user-friendly digital products. Before writing a single line of code, wireframes help us plan how things will look and work. They're like a blueprint for apps or websites.

In this project, you'll learn the **what**, **why**, and **how** of wireframing, and practice using tools like **Figma** to turn ideas into interactive prototypes.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A good wireframe includes the basics that shape the user experience. Here are the key parts:

- **Layout Structure**  
  This is the skeleton of the page ‚Äì where things go and how they‚Äôre arranged. For example, a header at the top, content in the middle, and a footer at the bottom.

- **Navigation**  
  Menus, links, and buttons that help users move around. Think of it like the map of your app or website.

- **Content Placement**  
  Shows where text, images, or videos will go. Helps decide what users see first and how information flows.

- **Functionality**  
  What happens when a user clicks something? Wireframes show which elements are interactive (like buttons or forms).

## Types of Wireframes

There are two main types of wireframes:

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes  
- Simple and quick sketches  
- Used early in the design process  
- Focus on layout and flow, not details  
- Example: Hand-drawn boxes on paper or quick drafts in Figma

### High-Fidelity Wireframes  
- More detailed and closer to the final design  
- Used later in the process  
- Show fonts, colors, spacing, and even interactions  
- Example: A detailed prototype in Figma with clickable buttons

## Wireframing Tools

There are many tools to help you create wireframes. Some popular ones include:

- **Figma** (our favorite!):  
  - Web-based and free to use  
  - Great for collaboration  
  - Allows real-time editing and prototyping  
  - Clean interface and easy to learn  

Other tools: Adobe XD, Sketch, Balsamiq

## Why Wireframing Matters in Development

Wireframes aren‚Äôt just for designers ‚Äî they help everyone involved in building a product:

- **Developers** understand what needs to be built.
- **Designers** can test ideas early without writing code.
- **Teams** can catch problems before they become expensive.
- **Clients and users** can give feedback early on.

By seeing a rough version of the product early, teams can align faster and avoid misunderstandings.

## Wireframing in Real Life

Imagine a team building a hotel booking website. Their first draft looked great ‚Äì but during wireframing, they realized:

- The navigation was confusing  
- Important actions like ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù were hard to find  
- Mobile layout didn‚Äôt work well

By fixing these early, they saved weeks of rework. When they finally built the real product, users found it easier and faster to book a room.

**Summary:**  
Wireframing helped spot problems early, test ideas, and build a product that worked for real people. It‚Äôs a small step with a big impact.
